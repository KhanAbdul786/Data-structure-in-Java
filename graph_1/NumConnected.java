//Problem statement
//An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water . A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given island to any other island in the same group . Given V islands (numbered from 0 to V-1) and E connections or edges between islands. Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.
//
//Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
//Constraints :
//0 <= V <= 1000
//0 <= E <= (V * (V-1)) / 2
//0 <= a <= V - 1
//0 <= b <= V - 1
//Time Limit: 1 second
//Sample Input 1:
//5 8
//0 1
//0 4
//1 2
//2 0
//2 4
//3 0
//3 2
//4 3
//Sample Output 1:
//1
